Given:

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
-- Steve Jobs

Note: For questions 2 and 3, place each answer inside a <p> tag. Also use character entities so the actual tags are visible on the web page.
Ex: &lt;img src="test.png"&gt; renders as <img src="test.png">

Question 2: Print an ampersand in an HTML comment.

Create a table with 3 rows and 3 columns. The top row contains 1 cell that spans 3 columns. The leftmost cell on the next row spans 2 rows. All other cells span a single row and column.

Each cell has a number. The numbers can be put in an <h1> tag if desired. The image below shows what the table should look like using <h1> tags around the numbers.
To help illustrate cell location and row/column spans, the image of the table with borders is provided below. Borders are not required for credit in this lab, but can be added if desired.
