Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.

Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
Use CSS to format the web page so it looks exactly like the screenshot below:



Requirements
Use either an embedded stylesheet or inline styles for all formatting.
Use a <div> for each of the 4 verse containers and the outer container.
The title “Yesterday” uses an <h2> tag with a 16pt Arial font that is blue and italicized. Do not use an <i> tag.
The entire song is embedded in a container that is 600 x 280 pixels, has a two pixel solid blue border, and a five pixel padding. The background color is #F0F0F0.
The outer <div>'s first child is the <h2>. The 4 child <div>s follow, declared in the order listed below.
The yellow section:
has a background color of "yellow"
floats to the left
has a 200 pixel width
has a 10 pixel padding
has a right margin of 10 pixels, with all other margins set to 0
The section with no background color has no CSS styling.
The orange section:
has a background color of "orange"
is positioned at (110px, 200px) with absolute positioning
has a 200 pixel width
has a 10 pixel padding
The orange-red section:
has a background color of "rgb(255, 80, 0)"
has white text
floats to the right
has a 200 pixel width
has a 10 pixel padding
has a right margin of 40 pixels, a top margin of 20 pixels, and all other margins set to 0
Do not use <br> anywhere in your HTML.
